              I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior
              knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, I
              was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master
              the soft skills required for being a software developer. So far so
              good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my
              career as a software developer. <br />

              Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
              in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
              different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
              fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
              presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
              Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed. <br />

          <h3>Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h3>
          <p>
            There's never been a better time to start a career as a web
            developer because there is a consistent demand for developers who
            both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can
            design creative solutions. The web and the applications built for it
            have transformed the way we do business globally, and is disrupting
            industries from education to manufacturing.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of
            The Course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most
            used web-based programming language - JavaScript. You'll have built
            several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have
            experience working with a team in a development environment. You'll
            gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing
            field. You'll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines
            that touch web development - managing complex data sets, securing
            your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and
            deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.
          </p>

          <h3>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB
            RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk
            you through installing the necessary free software. At least, you'll
            require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous
            programming language experience is required.
